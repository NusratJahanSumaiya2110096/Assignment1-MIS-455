		<p><u><b>History:</b></u>
			The mosque complex was designed by architect, Abdulhusein M. Thariani.[5] On 27 April 1959, Abdul Latif Ibrahim Bawani, owner of then Bawani Jute Mills, held a meeting at his house with GA Madani, Haji Abdul Latif Bawani, MH Adamji, S Sattar, Muhammad Sadiq, AZN Rezai Karim and Major General Umrao Khan.[6] In that meeting he proposed to Major General Khan, then military administrator of East Pakistan, that a grand mosque be built in Dhaka. Umrao Khan agreed to help build such a mosque. The same year, a Baitul Mukarram mosque committee was established and 8.30 acres of land between new Dhaka and Old Dhaka was chosen for the site. At that time, there was a large pond in the present mosque's location. It was known as Paltan pond. The pond was filled up and on 27 January 1960, then president of Pakistan Ayub Khan, commenced the work. Prayers took place for the first time on Friday, 25 January 1963. On 28 March 1975, the Government of Bangladesh entrusted the management of the mosque to the Islamic Foundation Bangladesh.

The mosque complex includes shops, offices, libraries and parking areas within it. Unusually, the mosque does not have a dome. In 2008, the mosque was extended, financed by a donation from the government of Saudi Arabia.</p>
